***How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	By using diff, we can see that in which line modifications were made,so by only examining these changed lines,we can 		identify the bug.

***How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	As a programmer,we make changes in the code whenever we open the code.it's always helpful to have previous version 		of code and compare the new code to see how a bug was introduced or to simply compare which approach is better or 		sometimes to simply how something was implemented(if you forget the code ;) )

***What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    

***Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 		like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	
	because is made for handling big projects.In programming to do one single task,sometimes we have to make changes in
	multiple files.so a single logical change may result in changing more than 1 files.
	whereas in google docs,we work in a single file.

***How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log simply tells me the date,time,commit id and the commit message.this commit message will tell me what changes 	 were introduced in this commit and then by using git diff I can compare this commit with the previous one to see the 	changes that were made.

***How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	I don't have to keep backups of big projects or try to remember what I did in the past or what i have changed.I'll
	simply make the change and if any bug appears then i'll simply see the difference b/w two commits by 
	git diff command and then identify the bug.

***Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	
	I want to try git to develop my android apps and also collaborate in blood donation collaborative project that is
	ongoing in my scholarship
